# Counter-Strike 2 FGD
A WIP FGD for CS2 (For use in Half-Life: Alyx Hammer)

To use, Add the FGD files to the "game/hlvr" folder in your Alyx directory. When it asks to replace the hlvr.fgd file, do it.

Very Basic at the moment. These things... They take time.

Currently Includes

| Entity       | Condition      |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| info_player_terrorist | Fully Functional
| info_player_counterterrorist  | Fully Functional
| func_buyzone  |  Fully Functional
| func_bomb_target |  Fully Functional

I will take feedback as I develop this.
