# Counter-Strike 2 Map Making Basic Setup

Some basic setups for making maps for CS2 using [Half-Life: Alyx Workshop Tools](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx_Workshop_Tools/Installing_and_Launching_Tools)

Check out my [Guide on Making Maps for Counter-Strike 2 with Half-Life: Alyx Workshop Tools](https://4kliksalex.blogspot.com/2023/04/mapping-counter-strike-2-with-half-life.html)

NOTE: This version is for the Half-Life: Alyx tools. If you don't have HLA, there is a SteamVR Home Version [here](https://github.com/Gman-HLA-sbox-modder/cs2-fgd/tree/steamvr-tool-ver).

Add the FGD files to the "game\hlvr" folder in your Alyx directory. Replace the original hlvr.fgd file.

Very Basic at the moment. These things... They take time.
